<p>If you are unsure of your shoe size, try to use a ruler to get an approximate measurement. However, because the foot is three dimensional, this may not be a completely accurate measurement. Please keep in mind that manufacturers use different measures to construct their shoes and sizing may vary accordingly. Our recommendation is to try on a few shoes in an actual brick and mortar store to get an idea of what your size is.</p>

<p>Fragile items&#160;leave our warehouse within 1-10 business days.</p>
<p>We cannot ship&#160;fragile items to rural routes, Hawaii and Alaska, APO/FPO addresses, or P.O. boxes.</p>
<p>If we can arrange to deliver&#160;fragile items to a remote or isolated area not commonly serviced by freight carriers, delivery may take an additional 1-2 weeks and may incur a fee.</p>
<p>Fragile&#160;items arrive directly to your shipping address via a freight carrier.</p>
<p>The carrier will use the phone numbers you provide during checkout to contact you 24-48 hours prior to delivery to arrange a delivery time. (Available delivery times vary depending on the freight carrier's schedule.)</p>
<p>Our freight carriers provide&#160;fragile standard delivery service unless a ""White Glove Delivery"" notation is on the product page</p>
<p>Delivery time for most&#160;fragile items is 1-6 weeks from the shipping date.</p>
<p>Inspect the delivery carton for any damage, crushing, dents, creasing, etc. before signing the delivery receipt.</p>
<p>The carrier driver will not wait as you unpack and inspect the item unless there is visible damage to the package.</p>
<p>When you sign the delivery receipt, the driver will leave.</p>
<p><b>Shipment Damage</b><a name=""2""></a></p>
<p>If you see obvious damage to your shipment carton, you may ask the driver to open the carton and inspect the contents with you.</p>
<p>If upon inspection you find damage, you may refuse the shipment and write, ""Refused, due to damage"" on the delivery receipt. Keep a copy of the delivery receipt with your damage notations and contact Customer Care immediately.</p>
<p>Keep all packaging materials for 30 days to use in a return in case you discover damage or defects after delivery.</p>
<p>If you discover damage or a defect after delivery, contact Customer Care. We will work to resolve the issue and, in our sole discretion, we may:</p>
<p>Arrange a repair or replacement if an item falls under a manufacturer's warranty;</p>
<p>Arrange for and pay the cost for repair of an item that does not fall under a manufacturer's warranty;</p>
<p>Issue a replacement; or Authorize a return</p>
<p><b>Delivery sites</b><a name=""2""></a></p>
<p>Carriers deliver most fragile items only to the nearest ground-level entrance of your home, business, or residence.</p>
<p>Exceptions to the above policy include apartments, unusual driveways, or any other obstacles that impede delivery.</p>
