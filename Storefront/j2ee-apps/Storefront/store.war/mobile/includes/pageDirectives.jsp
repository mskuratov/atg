  JSP 2.1 parameter. With trimDirectiveWhitespaces enabled,
  template text containing only blank lines, or white space,
  is removed from the response output.

  trimDirectiveWhitespaces doesn't remove all white spaces in a
  HTML page, it is only supposed to remove the blank lines left behind
  by JSP directives (as described here http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/jsp_21/)
  when the HTML is rendered.
